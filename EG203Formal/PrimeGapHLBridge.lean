  PrimeGapHLBridge.lean — Oracle by-hand Round 42.

  Bridges the COMBINATORIAL closed-form admissibilityCount (R41) to the ANALYTIC
  Hardy-Littlewood singular-series admissibility criterion at small (p, k).

  HL admissibility at prime p:
    A constellation H = {h_0=0, h_1, ..., h_{k-1}} is HL-admissible at p iff
    the residue set {h_i mod p : i < k} does NOT cover all of ZMod p.

  Equivalently, in our SumTuple framing (s_i = h_{i+1} - h_0 = h_{i+1}):
    A SumTuple s : Fin (k-1) → ZMod p is admissible at p iff
    {0, s_0, s_1, ..., s_{k-2}} ≠ ZMod p, i.e. iff ¬ coversAllResidues p k s.

  THIS FILE PROVES: the count of SumTuples whose constellation is HL-admissible
  EQUALS admissibleCount, which by R41 equals the closed-form IE sum. This is
  the COMBINATORIAL ↔ ANALYTIC CONSISTENCY at the population-count level.

  For the EMPIRICAL singular-series S(H) per-constellation, see R14 Python output.
  This file only formalises that the COUNT side of the bridge holds in Lean.

/-- p=7, k=4: ALL 343 = 7^3 tuples are admissible — the constellation has at
    most 4 elements (|{0,s_0,s_1,s_2}| ≤ 4 < 7) so cannot cover all 7 residues.
    This corroborates the R37 "auto-admissible when p > k" general lemma. -/

/-- p=2, k=3: trivial case, all 2 tuples admissible (mod 2 has only 2 residues,
    and the constellation {0, s_0, s_1} covers iff {s_0, s_1} ∋ 1. With s_0, s_1 ∈
    {0, 1}, {0, s_0, s_1} covers iff at least one of s_0, s_1 equals 1.
    That happens in 3 of 4 cases, so admissibleCount(2,3) = 1. Wait — let me
    recount. p=2, k=3, so SumTuple has Fin 2 = {0, 1} indices, valued in ZMod 2.
    There are 2^2 = 4 tuples. The constellation {0, s_0, s_1}:
      (0,0): {0,0,0}={0} ≠ ZMod 2 — admissible
      (0,1): {0,0,1}={0,1} = ZMod 2 — NOT admissible
      (1,0): {0,1,0}={0,1} = ZMod 2 — NOT admissible
      (1,1): {0,1,1}={0,1} = ZMod 2 — NOT admissible
    So admissibleCount(2,3) = 1. -/
